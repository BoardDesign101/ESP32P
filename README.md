# ESP32P
This project is based on ESP32 Dev Kit Module, The idea behind isn't all about making the same as other project makers do, 
I added some changes to it in part list so if you want to do the same keep in mind you dont need the same tolerance values I used,
For ex: 10V [C] 10uF +-20% (Er = X5R), Footprint (Case Code - 'in') 0402 / 0603 / 0805 / 1206 etc' .. ** Do not use 0201 for this project! **
I'v Used EasyEDA but you can use from your own choosing and convenient tool such as Altium Designer KiCAD etc' ..
I found EasyEDA and KiCAD are the fastest to do so..
